# Defaults for running Drupal Caravan on the host machine
# https://github.com/SU-SWS/drupal-caravan
# =======================================================
#
# These default values are used when setting up the host machine. A host machine
# might be your laptop, it might also be a TravisCI or Acquia Pipelines container.
# There should only be one host within this local group. While many of these variables
# concern and configure a container, the reason they are in the local group_vars
# file is because they are only used to create the container on a local host,
# and therefore only used against a local host.
#
# ANSIBLE_CONNECTION:
# Ansible is often used to run playbooks against dozens or sometimes thousands
# of remote hosts.  In this case, however, we want a few setup and teardown commands
# to be run locally.
# Required Value:
# local
#
# DISTRO:
# DrupalVM has several different Docker images that you can use as a foundation
# for your environment.
# Example: ubuntu1604 (recommended), debian9
#
# IP_ADDRESS:
# DrupalVM chose 192.168.88.88 as a default IP address to use. This value
# will be added to your /etc/hosts file, along with your {{ sitename }}, so that
# you can access your container through your local browser. If you already
# have a VM using this IP address, or find yourself restricted to an IP address
# range, then you can change this value. For more information, see:
# http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/networking/#network-route-collision.
# Example:
# 192.168.88.88, 172.16.0.88
#
# HTTP_PORT:
# Since 80 is a pretty popular port, we set the default for this container to
# 9000. This means that the container will open a port by this number for your
# local machine to access, ie. http://{{ sitename }}.local:9000.  We're assuming most
# local computers will already have processes running on port 80. You can change
# this value to any port number, assuming no process is already running on the
# same port.
# Example:
# 9000, 80
#
# HTTPS_PORT:
# Similarly, since 443 is a pretty popular port for HTTPS, we set the default
# for this container to 9003. This means that you should be able to access the
# site over HTTPS at https://{{ sitename }}.local:9001.
# Example:
# 9001, 443
