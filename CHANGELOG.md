# Drupal Caravan

1.0.0-beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Release Date: 2017-07-20

- Moved caravan.yml to build repo root, as the acquia setup process now runs `composer update`, which destroys the vendor/su-sws/drupal-caravan directory and everything in it.  We'll need to exclude caravan.yml from build repo.
- Moved default variables to host group specific group_vars files.  And all possible variable customizations to a single, default.caravan.yml file.  This has the disadvantage of leaving roles without their own self-contained default variables.  But it has the advantage of allowing a user to specify different variables for different hosts.
- Changed variable names to reflect which host this variable will affect.
- Moved hosts file and docker.py to inventory directory and specified inventory path with ansible.cfg file.  Ansible.cfg is also available now for further custom config options down the road, like logging.
- Added standardized documentation to variables files, roles, and playbooks.  Documentation includes known issues or areas for improvement, with links to project issues weâ€™re actively monitoring.
- Added an uninstall task to remove the /etc/hosts entry and IP alias.
