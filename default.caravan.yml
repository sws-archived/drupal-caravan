# Config file for Drupal Caravan
# https://github.com/SU-SWS/drupal-caravan
# ========================================
#
# Save this file to the root directory of your build repository as
# caravan.yml. To use different values per host, you can also save copies
# to provisioning/group_vars/[group_name].yml or edit the default group_vars
# files in provisioning/group_vars.
#
# KNOWN ISSUES:
# With this structure, roles are not self-contained. They rely on variables
# outside the role directory. Another organization would be to save default
# values in roles/role-name/defaults/main.yml. The reason I chose not to do this
# is because so many variables are shared between multiple roles, and might be
# host specific.
#
#
# Default values used in multiple roles against multiple hosts
# ============================================================
#
# Enter a nickname for your project. Use underscores, not hyphens.
# This value will be used to determine a number of variables in the created
# environment, for example, container name, database name, webroot, etc.
sitename:                          "caravan"
#
localhost_project_path:            "/home/travis/build/stanford-earth/SE3_BLT"
#
# Enter the absolute path to your local copy of the build repository.
# Do not include /docroot in the path.  This directory should include
# the composer.json project for this project.
#localhost_home_path:               "/Users/johndoe"
#
# Enter the filename of an ssh key that gives you access to cloud hosted
# copies of the production database.
#localhost_ssh_key_name:            "acquia_id_rsa"
#
# Enter the server address we can use to download a fresh copy of the site's
# production database and files.
#container_production_host_address: "earthstg.ssh.prod.acquia-sites.com"
#
#
# Variables for running Drupal Caravan on localhost
# =======================================================
#
# These default values are used when setting up the host machine. A host machine
# might be your laptop, it might also be a TravisCI or Acquia Pipelines container.
# There should only be one host within this local group. While many of these variables
# concern and configure a container, the reason they are in the local group_vars
# file is because they are only used to create the container on a local host,
# and therefore only used against a local host.
#
#
# DrupalVM has several different Docker images that you can use as a foundation
# for your environment.
#container_distro:                  "ubuntu1604"
#
# DrupalVM chose 192.168.88.88 as a default IP address to use. This value
# will be added to your /etc/hosts file, along with your {{ sitename }}, so that
# you can access your container through your local browser. If you already
# have a VM using this IP address, or find yourself restricted to an IP address
# range, then you can change this value. For more information, see:
# http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/networking/#network-route-collision.
#container_ip_address:              "192.168.88.88"
#
# Since 80 is a pretty popular port, we set the default for this container to
# 9000. This means that the container will open a port by this number for your
# local machine to access, ie. http://{{ sitename }}.local:9000.  We're assuming most
# local computers will already have processes running on port 80. You can change
# this value to any port number, assuming no process is already running on the
# same port.
#localhost_http_port:               9000
#
# Similarly, since 443 is a pretty popular port for HTTPS, we set the default
# for this container to 9003. This means that you should be able to access the
# site over HTTPS at https://{{ sitename }}.local:9001.
#localhost_https_port:              9001
#
# This is the absolute path where Caravan will install your site within the container.
#container_webserver_root:          "/var/www/"

# Variables for running Drupal Caravan against a container
# ========================================================
#
# These default values will be used to configure your Docker container.
# Imagine them as the variables you would put in a docker-compose file.
# They will determine how your host machine, ie. local machine, connects
# with the container.  And be used by applications like DrupalVM to configure
# your container accordingly.
#
# These variables will be used against all containers within the docker-hosts
# inventory group.  This group is dynamically created by the docker.py script.
#
# Since we have chosen to build sites with composer, we have separated files
# required to build a site from the site files. Site files are installed in a
# sub-directory, within the build repository. For example, /var/www/{{ sitename }}/docroot.
# Do not include any preceding nor trailing slashes.
#container_site_install_directory:  "docroot"
#
# Acquia BLT has a dependency that appears to require PHP7. However, some
# parts of their infrastructure are supposedly still on PHP5.6. We'll be using
# PHP 7.0 by default, but you can change this value to your need.
#container_php_version:             "7.0"
